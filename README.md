## Before installation

### BIOS(UEFI) configuration:

Access the BIOS setup by pressing F2 then select Advence Configuati√≥n by pressing F7

### Build your USB installer

1. Download Hig Sierra via the Mac App Store https://itunes.apple.com/cl/app/macos-high-sierra/id1246284741?mt=12
2. Create installer usb using Unibeast http://www.unibeast.com. The version used is this
3. Mount the usb drive's EFI partition to edit its content. When you finish installing with Unibest the partition is already mounted, but if you need to access again in the future you can use Clover Configurator, EFI Mounter v3 or simply use the terminal
4. Edit the EFI/CLOOVER/config.plist file that is inside the EFI partition. You can edit it with Clover Configurator, but the patch that was necessary to boot the installer was not available in the interface. I simply opened the file and edited it with my favorite text editor. The only change you made was to change the 'FixHeaders' entry to true. The resulting configuration file is this
5. puts the SATA-100-series-unsupported.kext and SATA-200-series-unsupported.kext on EFI/CLOOVER/kexts/Others folder (Required to recognize the HDD)

After these steps, we are ready to install the operating system!!!!!
